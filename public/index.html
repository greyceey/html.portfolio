<hr />
<h3>Worrior nun</h3>
<p>I love this movie because of it action and the fact that it feels so real</p>
<h3>A week away</h3>
<P>I love this one because i'm a child and a lover of God, and i love how it portrays God in a good light</P>
<h3>Coco</h3> 
<p>I love this particular movie because it emphasises on letting children choos thei own carrer and not letting our own past experience limit them from doing what they love to do</p>
